#### Abstract

Smoking during pregnancy (SDP) and environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure are major public health concerns associated with multiple negative outcomes for babies. This project delves into the exploration and analysis of data from Dr. Lauren Micalizzi's research, focusing on examining the association between SDP and ETS and adolescent self-regulation, externalizing behavior, and substance use. An initial step involves creating summary variables for prenatal and postnatal smoke exposure indicators (SDP and ETS) and their intensities. Then we pre-process the data (cleaning and formatting) before assessing the missing data pattern. The main body of the exploratory analysis will be performed through univariate analysis, bivariate analysis, and investigating interrelations between targeted variables. The inherent self-report bias arising from the use of self-reported surveys, is acknowledged. There're substantial amount of missing values in the dataset. Significant differences in substance use status and dosage, and assessments scores between children with varying smoke exposure during and post-pregnancy are observed. The results supports the idea that there's an association between SDP and ETS and adolescent self-regulation, externalizing behavior, and substance use. The report identifies variables requiring further attention in subsequent research, and highlights unique patterns crucial to addressing Dr. Lauren Micalizzi’s research questions. The limitations of the study include bias due to data collection mechanisms and the smalle size of the data, which should be addressed in future anlaysis.

#### Guidelines



#### Data Availability

The data for this project is sourced from Dr. Lauren Micalizzi, and the mothers participating in this study were randomly selected from the participants in a prior study titled "*A Tailored Video Intervention to Reduce Smoking and Environmental Tobacco Exposure During and After Pregnancy: Rationale, Design and Methods of Baby’s Breath*". The dataset used in this project is not available to the public.
